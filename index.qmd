# Pathways to Meaningful Regional Employment in Southern Minnesota

## Purpose of the Research

This research examined which factors most strongly influence whether individuals achieve **meaningful employment within Southern Minnesota’s region (EDR 9 & 10)** after high school. Using both **contingency table analysis (effect sizes, trends over 1, 5, and 10 years)** and **CART modeling**, the goal was to identify which variables most reliably anchor individuals in the regional workforce versus those that push them toward statewide mobility, disconnection, or outmigration.

A special focus was also placed on **non-college graduates**, who represent a substantial share of the region’s young adults and are at higher risk of disconnection from the labor force. Understanding their pathways provides additional insights into how to build a stronger, more inclusive regional workforce.

The findings provide a roadmap for education and workforce policy, showing how **demographics, high school context, accomplishments, and postsecondary experiences** interact to shape local labor market attachment.

## Post-secondary relationships

Across all four postsecondary outcomes — **attended.ps, ps.grad, ps.grad.InstitutionSector, ps.grad.location, and highest.cred.level** — consistent patterns emerge about which factors shape educational attainment and how these pathways tie into **regional workforce retention versus mobility and disconnection**.

The evidence is clear: **postsecondary experiences are the strongest predictors of long-term employment outcomes**, but they are deeply influenced by demographic background, high school context, and student accomplishments. This creates a **dual-pipeline system**: one that anchors students to Southern MN through CTE and sub-baccalaureate credentials, and another that channels academically strong students into statewide or national mobility through 4-year and higher pathways.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **1. Attending Postsecondary Education**

-   **Key Predictors**: Economic status (low-income less likely to attend), race/ethnicity (persistent gaps), and special education status (lower attendance).\
-   **Takeaway**: Disadvantaged students are disproportionately less likely to enroll in PS at all, putting them at high risk of long-term disconnection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **2. Postsecondary Graduation (ps.grad)**

-   **Key Predictors**: Economic status and SPED remain barriers to completion; racial gaps persist; academic readiness improves odds of graduating.\
-   **Takeaway**: Simply **completing** PS dramatically reduces disconnection and boosts employment. Non-completers remain the most vulnerable group in the workforce pipeline.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **3. Institution Sector of Graduation (ps.grad.InstitutionSector)**

-   **Key Predictors**:
    -   **Academic rigor and PSEO** → 4-year completions.\
    -   **CTE engagement, SPED, and low-income** → 2-year completions.\
-   **Takeaway**: Institution type sorts students into applied versus academic pathways. Since **2-year completions are more strongly tied to regional employment**, CTE and disadvantage groups inadvertently form the backbone of Southern MN’s workforce, while academically strong students pursue more mobile 4-year pathways.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **4. Location of Graduation (ps.grad.location)**

-   **Key Predictors**:
    -   **Disadvantaged students (low-income, SPED, marginalized race/ethnicity)** → more likely to graduate in **Southern MN**.\
    -   **High scorers and PSEO participants** → more likely to graduate outside the region (other MN or out-of-state).\
    -   **Local economic conditions** (lower wages, higher unemployment) → stronger Southern MN completions.\
-   **Takeaway**: Regional completions are most common among disadvantaged groups and CTE students, reinforcing their role in regional workforce stability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **5. Highest Credential Earned (highest.cred.level)**

-   **Key Predictors**:
    -   **Academic rigor (ACT, MCA)** and **PSEO** → bachelor’s or higher.\
    -   **CTE engagement, low-income, SPED, disadvantaged counties** → associate or sub-associate.\
-   **Takeaway**: Credential level is the clearest stratifier of opportunity. **Bachelor’s+ aligns with mobility**, while **associate/sub-associate aligns with regional employment**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Overall Conclusion**

The postsecondary pipeline is shaped by **two reinforcing forces**:

1.  **Mobility Pipeline**:
    -   Driven by **academic rigor and PSEO**.
    -   Leads to **4-year+ degrees, completions outside the region, and statewide mobility**.
    -   Most common among advantaged, higher-scoring students.
2.  **Regional Pipeline**:
    -   Driven by **CTE engagement, 2-year institutions, economic disadvantage, SPED, and lower-wage/unemployment counties**.
    -   Leads to **associate/sub-associate degrees and Southern MN completions**, strongly tied to **meaningful regional employment**.
    -   Most common among disadvantaged students who remain anchored locally.

In short: **Southern MN’s workforce stability relies heavily on the regional pipeline of 2-year and CTE-driven pathways**, which disproportionately serve low-income and SPED students. Meanwhile, academically strong and advantaged students pursue 4-year and higher credentials, fueling statewide and out-of-state mobility.

**Policy Implication**: To strengthen the regional workforce, interventions should both (1) support disadvantaged students in completing and leveraging their 2-year pathways and (2) create incentives for academically strong students to remain engaged in the region after completing higher degrees.

## Prediction - Employment CART

### **Main takeaway**

Across all three binary comparisons and all time horizons (1, 5, and 10 years after graduation), the CART models consistently highlight a **dual pipeline** shaping workforce outcomes in Southern Minnesota:

1.  **Anchors to Regional Employment:**
    -   **CTE engagement and depth (≥2–5 courses, concentrator/completor status).**
    -   **Sub-baccalaureate pathways** (2-year credentials, certificates, some college).
    -   **Regional postsecondary attendance and graduation.**
    -   **Favorable local economic conditions** (competitive wages, lower unemployment).
2.  **Pathways to Statewide Mobility or Disconnection:**
    -   **Bachelor’s degree attainment and high academic achievement** (ACT ≥25–28, MCA Reading ≥4) consistently predict outward mobility into statewide labor markets.
    -   **Weak academic readiness** (low ACT, low MCA scores) and **lack of CTE engagement** predict disconnection (no record, not attending PS).
    -   **Structural disadvantages** (low-income, SpecialEd status, some racial/ethnic groups) persistently raise the risk of disconnection across all timeframes.

The synthesis underscores that **CTE and regional postsecondary pathways are the backbone of workforce retention**, while higher academic achievement and 4-year credentials lead to broader mobility. Disadvantaged groups remain at elevated risk of disconnection without targeted supports.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Year 1 after Graduation**

-   **Anchors:** Early anchoring comes primarily from **CTE engagement, math proficiency, and local labor market strength.**
-   **Barriers:** SpecialEd involvement, weak academic readiness, and lack of CTE drive early disconnection or statewide mobility.
-   **Interpretation:** At this stage, **exposure to CTE and basic academic preparation** are critical to prevent graduates from being disconnected from work or education.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Year 5 after Graduation**

-   **Anchors:** **Regional postsecondary engagement, CTE depth, and sub-baccalaureate completion** are most decisive.
-   **Barriers:** 4-year/Bachelor’s attainment predicts mobility out of the region; SpecialEd, gender, and racial disparities continue to shape risks of disconnection.
-   **Interpretation:** Mid-career, **institutional pathways (regional PS, CTE credentials)** dominate as anchors, while higher academic achievement channels students outward.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Year 10 after Graduation**

-   **Anchors:** Long-term anchoring depends on **regional postsecondary graduation, sustained CTE involvement, and competitive wage environments.**
-   **Barriers:** Weak academic scores, lack of PS/CTE ties, and subgroup inequities push graduates toward disconnection or employment outside the region.
-   **Interpretation:** At this stage, outcomes stabilize: **CTE and regional PS pipelines anchor students**, while **4-year pathways and weak local wages reinforce outward movement or disconnection.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Overall Summary**

The CART analyses converge on three central insights:

1.  **CTE engagement is the most consistent predictor of regional employment.** Even minimal exposure is protective, while concentrator/completor status provides the strongest anchor.
2.  **Regional postsecondary pathways matter profoundly.** Attendance and completion in Southern Minnesota institutions substantially increase the odds of regional employment at 5 and 10 years.
3.  **Mobility vs. disconnection split.**
    -   **Mobility:** High achievers and 4-year graduates are more likely to find meaningful employment statewide.
    -   **Disconnection:** Students with weak academic readiness, limited CTE, and structural disadvantages face higher risks of no employment record or PS engagement.

This duality reflects a **regional workforce pipeline rooted in CTE and 2-year credentials**, contrasted with a **mobility pipeline driven by academic achievement and 4-year degrees.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Policy/Practice Implications**

-   **Expand and deepen CTE opportunities**, ensuring more students complete concentrator/completor pathways and take multiple courses (≥2–5).
-   **Strengthen regional postsecondary connections**, positioning 2-year institutions as central anchors for workforce retention.
-   **Elevate sub-baccalaureate pathways** as critical contributors to regional workforce strength.
-   **Design retention strategies for 4-year graduates and high academic achievers**, offering internships, research, and professional opportunities tied to local industries.
-   **Target supports for vulnerable groups** (low-income, SpecialEd, racial/ethnic subgroups) to reduce disconnection.
-   **Maintain competitive local wages and employment opportunities** to counter outward mobility and anchor graduates long-term.

In short, the models reaffirm that **Southern Minnesota’s workforce is sustained by CTE and 2-year credentials**, but retaining academically strong and 4-year graduates will require intentional strategies. Meanwhile, **addressing equity gaps and economic competitiveness is essential** to prevent long-term disconnection.
